it feels like everyone has their own bot these days

I think I'm gonna dump this folder here now since there's not really anything else I wanna add but it'll probably see some new stuff over time

I tried to make it easy for anybody to run on their own, like a pet or something. really, making bots is actually quite simple.

and it's even easier to steal someone's work. even if you can't code, go on.

## instructions
- make sure you got python
- run setup.bat
- follow instructions
- have fun
- probs only works on windows I dunno I'm only partially a nerd

## modding notes
it doesn't use ext.commands because uhhh... I dunno just to make it more complicated :)

not sure how ext.commands works but I have my own simple commands system in place

you guys can probably take a look around this mess and figure things out

I tried to make it flexible. perhaps I will make a guide if somebody asks.
